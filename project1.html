        The idea is a decentralized way to meet consensus through working toward
        a single truth that is verified by workers who are so-called miners. Of
        course, there is a more in-depth way to understand how actually the
        mechanism works within computer programming. However, for people that
        just barely know about crypto, it can help them to understand the core
        concept about why PoW is important.
